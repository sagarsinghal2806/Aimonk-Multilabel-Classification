## ⬇️ Model Weights Download

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the trained model weights (`deep-model.pth`) are hosted on Google Drive. You can download them using the link below:

**[Download deep-model.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RaFJT9MunU_zg50dVZK-9WUIcWIJ2XUo/view?usp=sharing)**

> **Note:** Place the downloaded `.pth` file in the root directory of this repository before running `inference.py`.
